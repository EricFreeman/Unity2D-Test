Unity2D-Test
============

Just playing around with Unity2D and seeing what differs between it and Unity3D.

This project is a top-down SHMUP (shoot-em-up).  The GUI is done with the wonderfully extensible nGUI (currently using the free version).  The levels are loaded from XML files.  I use a custom editor to create the levels: https://github.com/EricFreeman/ShmupLevelEditor

This project and the accompanying editor are very much still in the pre-alpha stage.
